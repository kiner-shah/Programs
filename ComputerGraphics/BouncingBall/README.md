# Bouncing Ball

A simple animation of a ball bouncing on a floor when left to fall from a certain height.

Dependencies:
1. [WinBGIm](http://www.codecutter.net/tools/winbgim/) library - emulates Borland BGI in modern compilers

To see how to use modern compilers to build this file using Code::Blocks IDE, see [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/include-graphics-h-codeblocks/).

> *Note*: The header files on official website have a bug. To see how to fix the bug and compile using corrected files and library, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57507125). I have however uploaded the winBGIm library files [here](../winBGIm)

Some changes that can be done:
1. Using OpenGL library for graphics.
